                        <h1>Reflective Essay</h1>
                        <p>To be honest, I personally did not expect anything more from this course. Even though the knowledge gained on it with a high probability could be useful to me in my future career, I still did not pay much attention to the subject. And there are several reasons for this, which I will write about below. In addition to them, in this essay, I also want to pay attention to those things that I did learn, as well as to talk about those aspects of this subject area that I did not even know were important.</p>
                        <p>First, I want to express my opinion about the study of non-core subjects in such a course as software development. Yes, I think project management is not what novice programmers need, whose goal is to quickly acquire applied skills and meet the needs of the market. In our university, project management is segregated as a program and is studied in more depth by other groups, and I believe that teaching the same subject to students in a software development course will only worsen their learning process and waste their time that they should have devoted to preparing their knowledge for the beginning of his career, which is quite competitive in our field. Secondly, I believe that the importance of this subject specifically for programmers is revealed in the middle of their career, when they begin not just to write code, but to manage a team and actively communicate with other roles involved in the development of the project.</p>
                        <p>Now let's talk about why this course might still be useful for some. In this course, we can learn how to correctly draw up documents and reports related to various stages of project development. This can be very useful for those who want to further develop in this area, since the templates that we used are not only systematic, but also meet the real requirements of the real world. We divided development reporting into 4 stages: Project Proposal, Project Initiation, Project Planning and Project Execution. In the first report, we wrote about what thoughts and problems led to the idea of creating this project, what resources we will need to implement and what goals we want to achieve, as well as what practical results we want to achieve. Our project was, and still is, a system that uses its own links to track and analyze the traffic passing through it is using packet headers. In the same document, we outlined the budget and sponsors of our project. In Project Initiation, we described in more detail all the resources and tools we need, in our case, these are programming languages and devices that will be used during development. We also described the roles that are involved in the project, and the elements of the system for which they are responsible. Already at this stage, I began to realize the value of these reports. Even without thinking about it, the most common use of these documents is to record the state of the project and its participants at a certain point in time. In complex and complex projects that can be developed by a large number of people and over a long period of time, such documents can be incredibly important, as they help to set a clearer framework for the project and keep track of all changes. In the next report, which is called Project Planning, I wrote in more detail about all the processes and tasks that need to be completed, I also set their priority and the time period in which this task should be completed. I could call this report the most important for me, since I do such things very often, even if they are written in a different form, the essence remains the same. To write any algorithm, you need to divide the problem into smaller ones; to write a system, you need to divide it into separate, independent elements. We did the same here. In the last report, we wrote in full detail about how the budget will be spent, how new changes to the system and development process will be considered and brought in, and we also prioritized the results.</p>
                        <p>To be honest, I did not set any specific tasks for this subject, since my subject area slightly overlaps with the one being studied on the subject. But there are nuances, because I saw new aspects of the development of a system, the development of a project, what is happening outside the screen of my monitor. Thanks to this experience, I can now understand documents and reports of this kind, as well as be able to understand and help the people who will be involved in their creation. And this will help me to be more involved in the project, and help me develop my communication skills, which I think is incredibly important for a developer these days.</p>
